Morphological segmentation exploration

A large part of the motivation for this repo is to replicate the experiments described in https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1005.pdf. So far, only the neural seq2seq model (with multi-task training option) is available.

Over time, I plan to incorporate alternative approaches to learning morphological segmentation, including unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.
